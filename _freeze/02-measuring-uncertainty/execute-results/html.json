We can consider probability an extension of logic. Probability allows us to extend logic not only to work with absolute beliefs (true and false) but also to work with uncertain values (values between true and false).\n\nAn important part of logic is *negation.* When we say “not true” we mean false. Likewise, saying “not false” means true. We want probability to work the same way, so we make sure that the probability of X and the negation of the probability of X sum to 1 (in other words, values are either X, or not X). \n\n$$P(X) + \\neg{P(X)} = 1$$ {#eq-negation}\n\n## Calculating Probabilities by Counting Outcomes of Events\n\nThe most common way to calculate probability is to count outcomes of events. We have two sets of outcomes that are important:\n\n1. All possible outcomes of an event. For a coin toss, this would be “heads” or “tails.” \n2. The count of the outcomes you’re interested in. If you’ve decided that heads means you win, the outcomes you care about are those involving heads.\n\nIn probability theory, we use $\\Omega$ (the capital Greek letter omega) to indicate the set of all events:\n\n$$\\Omega = \\{heads, tails\\}$${#eq-omega}\n\n::: {#exm-1head-2-coins}\nWhat is the probability of getting at least one heads when we toss two coins? \n\n1. Count the list of all possible events:\n\n$$\\Omega = \\{(heads, heads), (heads, tails), (tails, heads), (tails, tails) \\}$$ {#eq-possible-events}\n\n2. How many events match our condition?\n\n$$\\{(heads, heads), (heads, tails), (tails, heads) \\}$$ {#eq-matching-events}\n\n3. Divide number of matches by number of all possible events:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{4}$$\nSolving harder probability problems of this nature often involves a field of mathematics called <a class='glossary' title='Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting. (BS, Chap.2) One of the basic problems of combinatorics is to determine the number of possible configurations of a given type. (Britannica)'>combinatorics</a>.\n\n:::\n\n## Calculating Probabilities as Ratios of Beliefs\n\nCounting events is only useful for physical objects. How to reason about more abstract problems? -- Making bets is a practical way that we can express how strongly we hold our beliefs.\n\n### Using Odds to Determine Probability\n\n<a class='glossary' title='In probability theory, odds provide a measure of the likelihood of a particular outcome. They are calculated as the ratio of the number of events that produce that outcome to the number that do not. Odds are commonly used in gambling and statistics. (Wikipedia)'>Odds</a> are a common way to represent beliefs as a ratio of how much you would be willing to pay if you were wrong about the outcome of an event to how much you’d want to receive for being correct. For example, say the odds of a horse winning a race are 12 to 1.\n\nOdds have a simple relation with <a class='glossary' title='Probability is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance of an event occurring. (OpenStax: Statistics) In the discrete case, to calculate the probability that a random variable takes on any value within a range, we sum the individual probabilities corresponding to each of the values. We use Pr to explicitly state that the result is a probability from a discrete probability distribution, whereas p(value) is a probability density from a continuous probability distribution. (Bayesian Statistics, Chap.3)'>probabilities</a>: the odds of an outcome are the ratio of the probability that the outcome occurs to the probability that the outcome does not occur. In mathematical terms, where p is the probability of the outcome and  1- p is the probability that the outcome does not occur:\n\n$$odds = \\frac{p}{1-p}$$ {#eq-odds-p}\n\n### Solving for the Probabilities\n\nUsing algebra we can convert @eq-odds-p to find the probability of a hypotheses:\n\n$$p = \\frac{odds}{1 + odds}$$ {#eq-p-odds}\n\n### Measuring Beliefs in a Coin Toss\n\nRather than thinking about a coin toss as an event, we can rephrase the question as “How strongly do I believe the next coin toss will be heads?” Now we’re not talking about $P(heads)$ but rather a hypothesis or belief about the coin toss, $P(H_{heads})$. Just like before, we need an alternate hypothesis to compare our belief with. \n\n## Wrapping Up\n\n- We explored two different types of probabilities: those of events and those of beliefs. \n- We defined probability as the ratio of the outcome(s) we care about to the number of all possible outcomes.\n\nWhile this is the most common definition of probability, it is difficult to apply to beliefs because most practical, everyday probability problems do not have clear-cut outcomes and so aren’t intuitively assigned discrete numbers. To calculate the probability of beliefs, then, we need to establish *how many times more we believe in one hypothesis over another*. One good test of this is how much you would be willing to bet on your belief\n\n## Exercises\n\nTry answering the following questions to make sure you understand how we can assign real values between 0 and 1 to our beliefs. \n\n::: {#exm-02-1}\nWhat is the probability of rolling two six-sided dice and getting a value greater than 7?\n\nFollowing @exm-1head-2-coins:\n\n1. @eq-possible-events: $36$\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Omega = \\{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) \\\\ \n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) \\\\ \n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) \\\\ \n(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) \\\\ \n(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) \\\\ \n(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) \\}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n2. @eq-matching-events:  $15$\n\n**Solution**: \n\n$$\\frac{15}{36} = \\frac{5}{12}$$\n:::\n***\n\n::: {#exm-02-2}\nWhat is the probability of rolling three six-sided dice and getting a value greater than 7?\n\n**Solution**:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npossible_events = dice_sum = success = 0\nfor (i in 1:6) {\n    for (j in 1:6) {\n        for (k in 1:6) {\n            possible_events <- possible_events + 1\n            dice_sum <- i + j + k\n            if (dice_sum > 7) {\n                success <- success + 1\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nglue::glue('Possible events = {possible_events}, \\n',\n            'Dice value > 7 = {success}, \\n',\n           'Probability = {success} / {possible_events} = {success / possible_events}')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> Possible events = 216, \n#> Dice value > 7 = 181, \n#> Probability = 181 / 216 = 0.837962962962963\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {exm-02-3}\nThe Yankees are playing the Red Sox.
