However, in real\n    life, this is rarely the case. Instead, we are given data, which we\n    use to come up with estimates for probabilities. This is where\n    statistics comes in: it allows us to take data and make estimates\n    about what probabilities we're dealing with.\n\n## A Strange Scenario: Getting the Data\n\nIf you drop a quarter into a black box, it eject sometimes two quarter but\nsometimes it \"eats\" your quarter. So the question is: \"What's the\nprobability of getting two quarters?\"\n\n### Distinguishing Probability, Statistics, and Inference\n\nIn all of the examples so far, outside of the first chapter, we've known\nthe probability of all the possible events, or at least how much we'd be\nwilling to bet on them. In real life we are almost never sure what the\nexact probability of any event is; instead, we just have observations\nand data.\n\nThis is commonly considered the division between probability and\nstatistics. In <a class='glossary' title='Probability is a mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance of an event occurring. (OpenStax: Statistics) In the discrete case, to calculate the probability that a random variable takes on any value within a range, we sum the individual probabilities corresponding to each of the values. We use Pr to explicitly state that the result is a probability from a discrete probability distribution, whereas p(value) is a probability density from a continuous probability distribution. (Bayesian Statistics, Chap.3)'>probability</a>, we know\nexactly how probable all of our events are, and what we are concerned\nwith is how likely certain observations are. For example, we might be\ntold that there is 1/2 probability of getting heads in a fair coin toss\nand want to know the probability of getting exactly 7 heads in 20 coin\ntosses.\n\nIn <a class='glossary' title='Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data.'>statistics</a>, we would look at\nthis problem backward: assuming you observe 7 heads in 20 coin tosses,\nwhat is the probability of getting heads in a single coin toss?

Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. (Wikipedia)'>inference</a>, and it is the\nfoundation of statistics.\n\n### Collecting Data\n\nWe want to estimate the probability that the mysterious box will deliver\ntwo quarters, and to do that, we first need to see how frequently you\nwin after a few more tries. We've got 14 wins and 27 losses.\n\nWithout doing any further analysis, you might intuitively want to update\nyour guess that P(two quarters) = 1/2 to P(two quarters) = 14/41. But\nwhat about your original guess---does your new data mean it's impossible\nthat 1/2 is the real probability?\n\n### Calculating the Probability of Probabilities\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nH_{1} \\space is \\space P(\\text{two coins}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\nH_{2} \\space is \\space P(\\text{two coins}) = \\frac{14}{41}\n\\end{align*}\n$$ \"How probable is what we observed if $H_{1}$ were true versus if\n$H_{2}$ were true?\" We can easily calculate this using @eq-pmf of the\nbinomial distribution from @sec-prob-dist.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code #lst-calc-pmf-example lst-cap=\"Calculating the Probability of Probabilities with dbinom()\"}\n(H1 <- dbinom(14, 41, 1/2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 0.01602537\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code #lst-calc-pmf-example lst-cap=\"Calculating the Probability of Probabilities with dbinom()\"}\n(H2 <- dbinom(14, 41, 14/41))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> [1] 0.1304709\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis shows us that, given the data (observing 14 cases of getting two\ncoins out of 41 trials), $H_{2}$ is almost 10 times more probable than\n$H_{1}$! However, it also shows that neither hypothesis is impossible\nand that there are, of course, many other hypotheses we could make based\non our data.\n\nIf we wanted to look for a pattern, we could pick every probability from\n0.1 to 0.9, incrementing by 0.1; calculate the probability of the\nobserved data in each distribution; and develop our hypothesis from\nthat.\n\n![Visualization of different hypotheses about the rate of getting two\nquarters](img/05fig01.jpg){#fig-05-01\nfig-alt=\"Visualization of different hypotheses about the rate of getting two quarters\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\nEven with all these hypotheses, there's no way we could cover every\npossible eventuality because we're not working with a finite number of\nhypotheses. So let's try to get more information by testing more\ndistributions. If we repeat the last experiment, testing each\npossibility at certain increments starting with 0.01 and ending with\n0.99, incrementing by only 0.01 would give us the results in @fig-05-02.\n\n![We see a definite pattern emerging when we look at more\nhypotheses](img/05fig02.jpg){#fig-05-02\nfig-alt=\"Visualization of different hypotheses about the rate of getting two quarters\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\nThis seems like valuable information; we can easily see where the\nprobability is highest. Our goal, however, is to model our beliefs in\nall possible hypotheses (that is, the full probability distribution of\nour beliefs).\n\nThere are two problems:\n\n1.  There's an infinite number of possible hypotheses, incrementing by\n    smaller and smaller amounts doesn't accurately represent the entire\n    range of possibilities---we're always missing an infinite amount.\n    (In practice, this isn't a huge problem.)\n2.  There are 11 dots above 0.1 right now, and we have an infinite\n    number of points to add. This means that our probabilities don't sum\n    to 1!\n\nEven though there are infinitely many possibilities here, we still need\nthem all to sum to 1. This is where the beta distribution comes in.\n\n## Beta Distribution {#sec-beta-distribution}\n\nUnlike the <a class='glossary' title='It is used to calculate the probability of a certain number of successful outcomes, given a number of trials and the probability of the successful outcome.

(BF, Chap.5)'>beta distribution</a> represents a\ncontinuous range of values, which allows us to represent our infinite\nnumber of possible hypotheses.\n\nWe define the beta distribution with a probability density function\n(<a class='glossary' title='A probability densitiy function (PDF) describes a probability distribution for a random, continuous variable.

(Statistics By Jim)'>PDF</a>), which is very similar to the probability mass\nfunction we use in the binomial distribution, but is defined for\ncontinuous values.\n\n::: {#thm-pdf-beta}\n#### Formula for the PDF of the beta function\n\n$$\nBeta(p; \\alpha,\\beta) = \\frac{p^{\\alpha - 1} \\times (1 - p)^{\\beta - 1}}{beta(\\alpha, \\beta)}\n$$ {#eq-pdf-beta}\n:::\n\n### Breaking Down the Probability Density Function\n\n`p`: Represents the probability of an event. This corresponds to our different hypotheses for the possible probabilities for our black box.\n\n`$\\alpha$`: Represents how many times we observe an event we care about, such as getting two quarters from the box.\n\n`$\\beta$`: Represents how many times the event we care about didn’t happen. For our example, this is the number of times that the black box ate the quarter.\n\n`$\\alpha + \\beta$`: The total number of trials. This is different than the binomial distribution, where we have `k` observations we’re interested in and a finite number of `n` total trials.\n\nThe top part of the <a class='glossary' title='A probability densitiy function (PDF) describes a probability distribution for a random, continuous variable. Use a probability density function to find the chances that the value of a random variable will occur within a range of values that you specify. More specifically, a PDF is a function where its integral for an interval provides the probability of a value occurring in that interval.

Using a PMF to calculate the likelihoods for all possible values of the discrete variable produces its PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION.(Statistics By Jim)'>PMF</a> in @eq-pmf.\n\n**Differences between the PMF of the binomial distribution and the PDF of the beta distribution**:\n\n- In the PDF, rather than $p^{k} \\times (1- p)^{n-k}$, we have $p^{\\alpha - 1} \\times (1 - p)^{\\beta - 1}$ where we subtract 1 from the exponent terms. \n- We also have another function in the denominator of our equation: the beta function (note the lowercase) for which the beta distribution is named. We subtract 1 from the exponent and use the beta function to normalize our values—this is the part that ensures our distribution sums to 1. The beta function is the integral from 0 to 1 of $p^{\\alpha - 1} \\times (1 - p)^{\\beta - 1}$. (A discussion of how subtracting 1 from the exponents and dividing by the beta functions normalizes our values is beyond the scope of this chapter.)\n\nWhat we get in the end is a function that describes the probability of each possible hypothesis for our true belief in the probability of getting two heads from the box, given that we have observed $\\alpha$ examples of one outcome and $\\beta$ examples of another. Remember that we arrived at the beta distribution by comparing how well different binomial distributions, each with its own probability $p$, described our data. In other words, the beta distribution represents how well all possible binomial distributions describe the data observed.\n\n### Applying the Probability Density Function to Our Problem\n\nWhen we plug in our values for our black box data and visualize the beta distribution, shown in @fig-05-03, we see that it looks like a smooth version of the plot in @fig-05-02.\n\n![Visualizing the beta distribution for our data collected about the black box](img/05fig03.jpg){#fig-05-03\nfig-alt=\"Visualizing the beta distribution for our data collected about the black box\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\nWhile we can see the distribution of our beliefs by looking at a plot, we’d still like to be able to quantify exactly how strongly we believe that “the probability that the true rate at which the box returns two quarters is less than 0.5.” \n\n### Quantifying Continuous Distributions with Integration\n\nThe beta distribution is fundamentally different from the binomial distribution in that with the latter, we are looking at the distribution of $k$, the number of outcomes we care about, which is always something we can count. For the beta distribution, however, we are looking at the distribution of $p$, for which we have an infinite number of possible values. \n\nWe know that the fundamental rule of probability is that the sum of all our values must be 1, but each of our individual values is *infinitely* small, meaning the probability of any specific value is in practice 0.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe zero probability of an event in a continuous distribution does not mean that this event never could happen. Zero probability only means that the events gets the probability measure of zero.\n\nOur intuition from discrete probability is that if an outcome has zero probability, then the outcome is impossible. With continuous random variables (or more generally, an infinite number of possible outcomes) that intuition is flawed. ([StackExchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/273398/207389))\n:::\n\nFor example, even if we divided a 1-pound bar of chocolate into infinitely many pieces, we can still add up the weight of the pieces in one half of the chocolate bar. Similarly, when talking about probability in continuous distributions, we can sum up ranges of values. But if every specific value is 0, then isn’t the sum just 0 as well?\n\nThis is where calculus comes in: in calculus, there’s a special way of summing up infinitely small values called the *integral.*\n\nIf we want to know whether the probability that the box will return a coin is less than 0.5 (that is, the value is somewhere between 0 and 0.5), we can sum it up like this:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{0.5} \\frac{p^{14 - 1} \\times (1 - p)^{27 - 1}}{beta(14, 27)}$$ {#eq-integral-example}\n\nR includes a function called `dbeta()` that is the PDF for the beta distribution. This function takes three arguments, corresponding to $p$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$. We use this together with R’s `integrate()` function to perform this integration automatically. Here we calculate the probability that the chance of getting two coins from the box is less than or equal to 0.5, given the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code #lst-dbeta-example-1 lst-cap=\"Probability of getting two coins from the box is less than or equal to 0.5, given the data\"}\nintegrate(function(p) dbeta(p,14,27),0,0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 0.9807613 with absolute error < 5.9e-06\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThe “absolute error” message appears because computers can’t perfectly calculate integrals so there is always some error, though usually it is far too small for us to worry about. This result from R tells us that there is a 0.98 probability that, given our evidence, the true probability of getting two coins out of the black box is less than 0.5. This means it would not be good idea to put any more quarters in the box, since you very likely won’t break even.\n\n## Reverse-Engineering the Gacha Game\n\nIn real-life situations, we almost never know the true probabilities for events. That’s why the beta distribution is one of our most powerful tools for understanding our data.\n\nIn @sec-gacha-games of @sec-prob-dist , we knew the probability of the card we wanted to pull. In reality, the game developers are very unlikely to give players this information, for many reasons (such as not wanting players to calculate how unlikely they are to get the card they want). \n\nThis time we don’t know the rates for the card, but we really want that card—and more than one if possible. We spend a ridiculous amount of money and find that from 1,200 cards pulled, we received only 5 cards we're interested in. Our friend is thinking of spending money on the game but only wants to do it if there is a better than 0.7 probability that the chance of pulling the card is greater than 0.005.\n\nOur data tells us that of 1,200 cards pulled, only 5 were cards we are interested in, so we can visualize this as Beta(5,1195), shown in @fig-05-04 (remember that the total cards pulled is $\\alpha + \\beta$).\n\n![The beta distribution for getting the card we are interested in, given our data](img/05fig04.jpg){#fig-05-04\nfig-alt=\"The beta distribution for getting the card we are interested in, given our data\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n\nFrom our visualization we can see that nearly all the probability density is below 0.01. We need to know exactly how much is above 0.005, the value that our friend cares about. We can solve this by integrating over the beta distribution in R:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code #lst-dbeta-example-2 lst-cap=\"Probability that the rate of pulling a card we are interested is 0.005 or greater\"}\nintegrate(function(x) dbeta(x,5,1195),0.005,1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n#> 0.2850559 with absolute error < 1e-04\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThis tells us the probability that the rate of pulling a card we are interested is 0.005 or greater, given the evidence we have observed, is only 0.29. Our friend will pull for this card only if the probability is around 0.7 or greater, so based on the evidence from our data collection, our friend should not try his luck.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nWe learned about the beta distribution, which is closely related to the binomial distribution but behaves quite differently. The major difference between the beta distribution and the binomial distribution is that the beta distribution is a continuous probability distribution. Because there are an infinite number of values in the distribution, we cannot sum results the same way we do in a discrete probability distribution. Instead, we need to use calculus to sum ranges of values. Fortunately, we can use R instead of solving tricky integrals by hand.\n\nWe built up to the beta distribution by observing how well an increasing number of possible binomial distributions explained our data. The beta distribution allows us to represent how strongly we believe in all possible probabilities for the data we observed. This enables us to perform statistical inference on observed data by determining which probabilities we might assign to an event and how strongly we believe in each one: a *probability of probabilities*.\n\n## Exercises\n\nTry answering the following questions to make sure you understand how we can use the Beta distribution to estimate probabilities.

But then I noticed that my graphics displays value from 0 to 1 whereas @fig-05-04 visualizes only values between 0 and 0.01! \n\nIn @lst-fig-repl-5-4b I changed the visualization just showing values from 0 to 0.01.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code #lst-fig-repl-5-4b lst-cap=\"Replication of Figure 5.4: The beta distribution for getting the card we are interested in, given our data\"}\ntibble::tibble(x = seq(from = 0, to = 0.01, length = 1000),\n              y = dbeta(x,5,1195)) |> \n\nggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_line() +\n    ggplot2::theme_bw() +\n    ggplot2::labs(\n        title = \"Pulling a Bradley Efron Card, Beta(5, 1195)\",\n        x = \"p\",\n        y = \"Probability\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The beta distribution form 0 to 0.01 for getting the card we are interested in, given our data](05-beta-distribution_files/figure-html/repl-5-4b-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
