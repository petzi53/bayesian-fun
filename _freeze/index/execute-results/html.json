During my study in sociology back in\n1970er I had only rudimentary learned about\n<a class='glossary' title='Also known as frequentist interference, is a type of statistical approach where conclusions are made based on the frequency of an event. This statistical approach determines the probability of a long-term experiment, meaning the experiment is repeated under the same set of conditions to obtain an outcome. In frequentist statistics the population parameters are fixed, but unknown, and the data observed in experiments are random. (deepai.org)'>frequentist statistics</a>. There weren't computer only via\ntime-sharing and keypunching for card-to-tape converter available. This\nwas painstaking and not motivating because it had not much practical\nvalues. 10 years later I worked sometimes with SPSS but used --- as many\nof my colleagues --- the \"statistics all\" option without much\nunderstanding. It was no fun and so I dedicated most of my time to\ntheoretical work and later sometimes to qualitative social research via\n[grounded theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory).\n\nOnly when I heard 2015 about R and began to exerpiment with it, I\nstarted my self-directed education in statistics again. Still I was not\nso intrigued by Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing (NHST) but more from\nData Science. I noticed the problems with p-values and was therefore\nfascinated with [Introduction to the New\nStatistics](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/) by Geoff Cumming &\nRobert Calin-Jageman [@cumming2017]. Instead of concentrating on\np-values the book teaches the importance of\n<a class='glossary' title='A range of values, calculated from the sample observations, that is believed, with a particular probability, to contain the true parameter value. (Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, 4th ed., p.98)'>confidence intervals</a>, (CIs). But\nat that time I came across some discussion about\n<a class='glossary' title='Also known as evidential probability, is the process of adding prior probability to a hypothesis and adjusting that probability as new information becomes available. Unlike traditional frequentist probability which only accounts for the previous frequency of an event to predicate and outcome, the Bayesian model begins with an initial set of subjective assumptions (prior probability) and adjusts them accordingly through trial and experimentation (posterior probability). Instead of only rejecting or failing to reject a null hypothesis, Bayesian probability allows someone to quantify how much confidence they should have in a particular result. (&lt;a href”https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/bayesian-probability&quot;&gt;deepai.org)'>Bayesian statistics</a>. I read [The Theory That Would Not\nDie](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np76s): How Bayes' Rule Cracked\nthe Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant\nFrom Two Centuries of Controversy by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne\n[@mcgrayne2011] but didn't understand at that time how Bayesian\nstatistics works.\n\nThe real game changer for me then was [Statistical\nRethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919)\nby Richard McElreath [@mcelreath2020]. I immediately started [my first\nQuarto book](https://bookdown.org/pbaumgartner/sr2-notes/) with notes\nabout the book and the companion bookdown website [*Statistical\nrethinking* with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second\nedition](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/) by A Solomon Kurz. But\nunfortunately after four chapters I noticed that I am lacking basic\nknowledge and looked around for other books on Bayesian statistics that\nare easier to digest for me. I tried A Student's Guide to Bayesian\nStatistics by Ben Lambert [@lambert2018], but I stopped reading it after\nchapter eight. I has to much theory for me and I was missing the\nopportunity trying my own hands out with R.\n\nSo finally I came around to Will Kurt's book. I understand that the\nmodern simulation methods like MCMC are not in the focus of the book and\nalso the usage of R code is distributed very sparsely in the book. But I\nlearned (and understood) many Bayesian concepts and could all the\ngraphics in the book --- where the R code is missing --- replicate with\n{**ggplot2**} [@ggplot2] in tidyverse [@tidyverse] style. The book was\nat the time (September/October 2023) a perfect match for my rudimentary\nknowledge. I have now more trust to continue with Statistical Rethinking\nor --- as a possible alternative --- to start with a new Quarto book on\n[Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial With R, JAGS, and\nStan](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/)\n[@kruschke2014] which I have already read and (I believe) mostly\nunderstood.\n\nAnother motivation to write a Quarto book was to learn how to use\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org/). I already wrote some books with bookdown\n[@bookdown] but Quarto was relatively new for me. This book was\ntherefore a good occasion to learn and experiment with the functionality\nof Quarto.\n\n## Content and Goals of this Book {.unnumbered}\n\nThis book collects personal notes during reading of [Bayesian Statistics\nthe Fun Way](https://nostarch.com/learnbayes) by Will Kurt. Additionally\nI am using [C: Answers to\nExercises](https://nostarch.com/download/resources/Bayes_exercise_solutions_new.pdf)\n\nEach chapter of the book has three main parts:\n\n### Short summaries of the book content {.unnumbered}\n\nThis summarizes my own highlights but gives also the necessary\ninformation for my section about \"Experiments\". Mostly I quote the text\nbut without page references. Often I made minor editing (e.g., shorting\nthe text) or put sometimes the content in my own wording. As I follow\nthe text section by section reader can easily find the quoted passage.\n\nAlmost all of my text of this first part of the Quarto book are not\nmine, but is coming from the resources mentioned above. There are two\nexceptions:\n\n-   Whenever necessary I include personal notes already in this part of\n    the chapter. Most of the time it is combined with a cross reference\n    to the third main part of the book: my experiments.\n-   Sometimes there is also base R Code by the author provided. Whenever\n    possible I convert this base R code by the author in {**tidyverse**}\n    code.\n-   I copied all figures into the text as a template for my own\n    replication.\n\n::: callout-important\nAlthough I have quoted many passages from the original as highlights for\nme to remember, this Quarto ebook is not meant to stand alone. My\nsummaries are driven by my personal interests and my huge gaps in my\nstatistical knowledge and especially in Bayesian statistics. My notes\nare therefore in no way a substitute for Will Kurt's book [Bayesian\nStatistics the Fun Way: Understanding Statistics and Probability With\nStar Wars, LEGO, and Rubber Ducks](https://nostarch.com/learnbayes) by\nWill Kurt [@kurt2019]. Please buy the book so that you can embed my\nnotes appropriately in the general argumentation of the author.\n:::\n\n### Exercises {.unnumbered}\n\nAgain I quote the full question text and then try my own solution. If my\nsolution is not correct or I cant find a solution I will note this in a\npersonal callout and will correct the solution. If my solution is\ncorrect but with a different method I will also reflect on the result,\nbut will not adapt or change my solution.\n\n### Experiments {.unnumbered}\n\nHere I am trying to make my own exercises. Most of the examples are\nreplications of the book figures because the author has not included the\nR code. Additionally I cross referenced to the figure from the first\npart, the author section. If you hover over the cross reference link you\nwill get the authors figure overlaid and can compare it with my\nreplication.\n\nWriting my own R chunks I am using the tidy approach with the collection\nof the {**tidyverse**} packages, especially with {**ggplot2**} for the\nfigures. But instead of using the `library()` command I always mention\nthe used packages explicitly. Whenever I used another packages I called\nthe function with the package name in front with the syntax\n`<package name>::<function name>()`, like `ggplot2::gplot()`. This is\ntedious work but it helps me to learn & remember which command \"belongs\"\nto which package. Only exception is the {**patchwork**} package, as I do\nnot know how to call commands like `p1 + p2` with the package name.\n\nIn graphics I use not only caption for figures but also captions for the\nR code. There is no easy standardized way to use code listings with\ncaptions and to evaluate the code at the same time, but I [found a\nworkaround](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1580#issuecomment-1552673825)\nwith the following structure of code options in the code chunk:\n\n```         \n#| label: fig-name\n#| fig-cap: \"fig-title\"\n#| attr-source: '#lst-fig-name lst-cap=\"list-title\"'\n```\n\nThis code generates a warning because at the moment the `=` symbol is\nnot allowed in RStudio when running a R chunks interactively in a Quarto\ndocument. [See issue\n13326](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/13326). Although I got\na warning the code does what I want: It gives the figure and the code\nlisting a heading and evaluates the code at the same time.\n\n## Glossary\n\nI started a glossary using the\n{[**glossary**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glossary/index.html)}\npackage by Lisa DeBruine [@glossary]. A glossary entry is visualized\nwith a double underline. Every chapter has a section where the text of\nall glossary entries of the chapter are displayed. When you hover with\nthe mouse over the link it opens a pop-up window with the glossary text.\nYou can see example in the section about my motivation for this ebook\n(See @sec-book-motivation).\n\nI am using this glossary for all my other Quarto books but it is till\nwork in progress. Please keep in mind that I collected the definition at\nvarious places and be attentive because there is no guarantee that the\nentry is appropriate and correct. I have added the sources where I got\nthe content for the glossary entry.\n\n## Session Info\n\nEvery chapter ends with a session information printed with the\n`sessionInfo()` function.\n\n::: callout-warning\n###### Warning\n\nI wrote this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to\nbe become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.\nPlease keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a\nlearner. In spite of replicating most of the content it may contain many\nmistakes. All these misapprehensions and errors are my responsibility.\n\nIn any case I am the only responsible person for this text, especially\nif I have used code from the resources wrongly or misunderstood a quoted\ntext passage.\n:::\n",
