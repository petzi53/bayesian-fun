# Creating a Binomial Probability Distribution

## Structure of a Binomial Distribution

A binomial distribution is used to calculate the probability of a
certain number of successful outcomes, given a number of trials and the
probability of the successful outcome. The "bi" in the term binomial
refers to the two possible outcomes that we're concerned with: an event
happening and an event not happening. (If there are more than two
outcomes, the distribution is called multinomial.)

Examples for a binomial distribution are:

-   Flipping two heads in three coin tosses
-   Buying 1 million lottery tickets and winning at least once
-   Rolling fewer than three 20s in 10 rolls of a 20-sided die

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#def-binom-dist-param}
#### Parameter for the binomial distribution

All binomial distributions involve three parameters:

-   `k` The number of outcomes we care about
-   `n` The total number of trials
-   `p` The probability of the event happening
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating the probability of flipping two heads in three coin tosses:

-   $k = 2$, the number of events we care about, in this case flipping a
    heads
-   $n = 3$, the number times the coin is flipped
-   $p = 1/2$, the probability of flipping a heads in a coin toss

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#thm-binomial-distribution-shorthand-notation}
#### Shorthand notation of a binomial distribution

$$B(k; n, p)$$ {#eq-short-notation}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example of two heads in three coin tosses, we would write
$B(2; 3, 1/2)$.

-   `B` stands for *binomial* distribution
-   `k` is separated from the other parameters by a semicolon. This is
    because when we are talking about a distribution of values, we
    usually care about all values of $k$ for a fixed $n$ and $p$.
-   `B(k; n, p)` denotes each value in the distribution
-   `B(n, p)` denotes the whole distribution

## Understanding and Abstracting Out the Details of Our Problem

We'll continue with the example of calculating the probability of
flipping two heads in three coin tosses. Since the number of possible
outcomes is small, we can quickly figure out the results we care about
with just pencil and paper.

$$HHT, HTH, THH$$ To start generalizing, we'll break this problem down
into smaller pieces we can solve right now, and reduce those pieces into
manageable equations. As we build up the equations, we'll put them
together to create a generalized function for the binomial distribution.

-   Each outcome we care about will have the *same* probability.
-   Each outcome is just a `r glossary("permutation")`, or reordering,
    of the others

$$
\begin{align*}
P({heads, heads, tails}) = P({heads, tails, heads}) = P({tails, heads, heads}) = \\
P(\text{Desired Outcome})
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-permutation-example}

See how to do this calculation with R in @sec-example-4-1.

There are three outcomes, but only one of them can possibly happen and
we don't care which. And because it's only possible for one outcome to
occur, we know that these are mutually exclusive, denoted as:

$$P(\{heads, heads, tails\},\{heads, tails, heads\},\{tails, heads, heads\}) = 0$$
This makes using the sum rule of probability easy.

$$
\begin{align*}
P(\{heads, heads, tails\} \operatorname{OR} \{heads, tails, heads\} \operatorname{OR} \{tails, heads, heads\}) = \\
P(\text{Desired Outcome}) + P(\text{Desired Outcome}) + P(\text{Desired Outcome}) = \\
3 \times P(Desired Outcome)
\end{align*}
$$ The value "3" is specific to this problem and therefore not
generalizable. We can fix this by simply replacing "3" with a variable
called $N_{outcomes}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#thm-pfm-placeholder}
#### Solution with place holders

$$B(k;n,p) = N_{outcomes} \times P(\text{Desired Outcome})$$ {#eq-pfm-placeholder}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we have to figure out two subproblems:

1.  How to count the number of outcomes we care about?
2.  How to determine the probability for a single outcome?

## Counting Our Outcomes with the Binomial Coefficient

First we need to figure out how many outcomes there are for a given k
(the outcomes we care about) and n (the number of trials). For small
numbers we can simply count. But it doesn't take much for this to become
too difficult to do by hand. The solution is
`r glossary("combinatorics")`.

### Combinatorics: Advanced Counting with the Binomial Coefficient

There is a special operation in combinatorics, called the *binomial
coefficient*, that represents counting the number of ways we can select
`k` from `n` --- that is, selecting the outcomes we care about from the
total number of trials.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#thm-binomial-coefficient}
#### Notation for the binomial coefficient

$$\binom{n}{k}$$ {#eq-binomial-coefficient}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We read this as "n choose k". In our example we would say "in three
tosses choose two heads":

$$\binom{3}{2}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#thm-def-bin-coeff}
#### Definition of the binomial coefficient operation

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! \times (n-k)!}$$ {#eq-def-bin-coeff}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `!` means *factorial*, which is the product of all the numbers up to
and including the number before the `!` symbol, so
$5! = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)$.

In R we compute the binomial coefficient for the case of flipping two
heads in three tosses with the following function call:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| label: binomial-coeff
#| attr-source: '#lst-binomial-coeff lst-cap="**Compute the binomial coefficient for flipping two heads in three tosses**"'

choose(3,2)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

See how to calculate the binomial coefficient with Base R in
@sec-example-4-2.

We can now replace $N_{Outcomes}$ in @eq-pfm-placeholder with the
binomial coefficient:

$$B(k;n,p) = \binom{n}{k} \times P(\text{Desired Outcome})$$

### Calculating the Probability of the Desired Outcome

All we have left to figure out is the $P(\text{Desired Outcome})$, which
is the probability of any of the possible events we care about. So far
we've been using $P(\text{Desired Outcome})$ as a variable to help
organize our solution to this problem, but now we need to figure out
exactly how to calculate this value.

Let's focus on a single case of our example of tow heads in three
tosses: $HHT$. Using the product rule and negation from the previous
chapter, we can describe this problem as:
$$P(heads, heads, no heads) = P(heads, heads, 1-heads)$$ Now we can use
the product rule from @eq-product-rule:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(heads, heads, 1-heads) = \\
P(heads) \times P(heads) \times (1-P(heads)) = \\
P(heads)^2 \times (1-P(heads))^1
\end{align*}
$$ You can see that the exponents for $P(heads)^2$ and $1 – P(heads)^1$
are just the number of heads and the number of not heads in our
scenario. These equate to `k`, the number of outcomes we care about, and
`n – k`, the number of trials minus the outcomes we care about. Puting
all together:

$$
\binom{n}{k} \times P(heads)^{k} \times (1- P(heads))^{n-k}
$$ Generalizing for any probability, not just heads, we replace
$P(heads)$ with just `p`. This gives us a *general solution*. Compare
the following list with @def-binom-dist-param.

-   `k`, the number of outcomes we care about;
-   `n`, the number of trials; and
-   `p`, the probability of the individual outcome.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {#thm-pmf}
#### Probability Mass Function -- PFM

$$
\binom{n}{k} \times p^{k} \times (1- p)^{n-k}
$$ {#eq-pfm}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

@eq-pfm is the basis of the binomial distribution. It is called a
`r glossary("Probability Mass Function")` (PMF). The *mass* part of the
name comes from the fact that we can use it to calculate the amount of
probability for any given `k` using a fixed `n` and `p`, so this is the
mass of our probability.

Now that we have this equation, we can solve any problem related to
outcomes of a coin toss. For example, we could calculate the probability
of flipping exactly 12 heads in 24 coin tosses:

$$
B(12,24,\frac{1}{2}) = \binom{24}{12} \times (\frac{1}{2})^{12} \times (1-\frac{1}{2})^{24-12} = 0.1611803
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| label: calc-example
#| attr-source: '#lst-calc-example lst-cap="**Calculate the probability of flipping exactly 12 heads in 24 coin tosses**"'

choose(24,12) * (1 / 2)^(12) * (1 - 1/2)^(24 - 12)

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The calculation in @lst-calc-example is only valid for our concrete
example.

For example, we can plug in all the possible values for `k` in 10 coin
tosses into our PMF and visualize what the binomial distribution looks
like for all possible values.

![Binomial Distribution for 10 Coin
Flips](img/BF-04-01.jpg){#fig-10-coin-flips
fig-alt="Bar graph showing the probability of getting k in 10 coin flips"
fig-align="center"}

See for my experiment in  to replicate @fig-10-coin-flips

We can also look at the same distribution for the probability of getting a 6 when rolling a six-sided die 10 times, as shown in @fig-10-dice-rolls.

![Binomial Distribution for 10 Coin
Flips](img/BF-04-02.jpg){#fig-10-dice-rolls
fig-alt="Bar graph showing the probability of getting a 6 when rolling a six-sided die 10 times"
fig-align="center"}

Again I will try to replicate @fig-10-dice-rolls. See @sec-example-4-4.

Bottom line of the discussion in this section: A probability distribution is a way of generalizing an entire class of problems.

## Example: Gacha Games

There is only one new content in this section: Instead of computing the probability of one event we are going to calculate the possibility of drawing *at least* one specific card from a pile of infinite numbers of cards where we know the probability of this card we are interested in.

In R, we can use the `pbinom()` function to automatically sum up all the values of the card we are interested in our PMF. 

![How the pbinom() functions works](img/BF-04-03.jpg){#fig-pbinom-function
fig-alt="Explaining the structure of the pbinom() function"
fig-align="center"}

The `pbinom()` function takes three required arguments and an optional fourth called `lower.tail` (which defaults to TRUE). When the fourth argument is TRUE, the first argument sums up all of the probabilities less than or equal to our argument. When `lower.tail` is set to FALSE, it sums up the probabilities strictly greater than the first argument. By setting the first argument to $0$, we are looking at the probability of getting one or more the cards we are interested. We set `lower.tail` to FALSE because that means we want values greater than the first argument (by default, we get values less than the first argument).

```{r}
#| label: use-pbinom-example
#| attr-source: '#lst-use-pbinom-example lst-cap="Example Calculation with the rbinom() Function"'

pbinom(0, 100, 0.00720, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Voilá! This is the same result as in @#fig-pbinom-function.

## Wrapping Up

In this chapter Will Kurt demonstrated how we can deduce intuitively the formula for the binomial coefficient. I have seen this monstrosity of expression many times in different books and was always overwhelmed from its complexity. But this has changed now: Will Kurt succeeded to demystify the formula for me!

## Exercises

## I STOPPED HERE

## Experiments

### Permutation with R {#sec-example-4-1}

I want to get the same result as in @eq-permutation-example, but this
time using R. What are the permutations of possible events by flipping
two heads in three coin tosses?

Let's P(heads) = 1 and P(tails) = 0, then we can use
`combinat::combn()`. The package {**combinat**} is not part of Base R,
so you have to install it.

```{r}
#| label: permutate-3-2
#| attr-source: '#lst-permutate-3-2 lst-cap="Permutations of possible events by flipping two heads in three coin tosses"'

combinat::combn(x = c(1,2,3), m = 2, fun = tabulate, simplify = TRUE, nbins = 3)
```

The syntax is: `combn(x, m, fun = NULL, simplify = TRUE, ...)`.

-   `x`: vector source for combinations equivalent to the the number of
    events.
-   `m`: number of elements we are interested in
-   `fun` = function to be applied to each combination (may be null). I
    am using the `base::tabulate()` to take the integer-valued vector
    and counting the number of times each integer occurs in it.
-   `simplify`: logical, if FALSE, returns a list, otherwise returns
    vector or array.
-   `...`: arguments for the used function. In our case `nbins` refers
    to the number of bin used by the `tabulate()` function.

Let's try another example to understand better the pattern of the
`combn()` functions: What are the permutations of possible events by
flipping a coin 5 times and getting three heads:

```{r}
#| label: permutate-5-3
#| attr-source: '#lst-permutate-3-2 lst-cap="Permutations of possible events by flipping two heads in five coin tosses"'

combinat::combn(x = 1:5, m = 2, fun = tabulate, simplify = TRUE, nbins = 5)
```

::: callout-tip
There is also a special package {**dice**} for the calculation of
various dice-rolling events. We could for instance compute the
probability "What is the probability of rolling two 6s in three rolls of
a six-sided die?" directly with:

```{r}
#| label: package-dice-example
#| attr-source: '#lst-package-dice-example lst-cap="Compute the probability of rolling two 6s in three rolls of a six-sided die"'

dice::getEventProb(nrolls = 3,
                   ndicePerRoll = 2,
                   nsidesPerDie = 6,
                   eventList = list(6, 6))
```
:::

::: callout-warning
Actually I did not understand the many implications of computing
combinations and / or permutations with different functions and
different packages:

-   `utils::combn()`
-   `combinat::combn()`
-   `gtools::combinations()` and `gtools::permutations()`
-   `permute::permute()`, `permute::shuffle()`
-   `base::expand.grid()`
-   `tidyr::expand()`, `tidyr::crossing()`, `tidyr::nesting()`,
    `tidyr::expand_grid()`

As far as I understand from my study of the Statistical Rethinking book,
these functions are an important topic to understand Bayesian
Statistics. These types of functions are used for grid approximation and
in Bayesian statistics to extract or draw samples from fit models (e.g.,
`rethinking::extract.samples()`, `rethinking::extract.prior()`)

I am sure I will need to come back to this issue and study available
material more in detail! But at the moment I am stuck and will skip this
subject.

### Compute binomial coefficient manually {#sec-example-4-2}

I want to replicate the Base R function `chosse()` with
@eq-def-bin-coeff. This involves to calculate factorials with the
`base::factorial()` function.

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! \times (n-k)!}$$

```{r}
#| label: binomial-coeff-example
#| attr-source: '#lst-binomial-coeff-example lst-cap="**Calculate the probability of flipping exactly 12 heads in 24 coin tosses**"'

my_choose <-  function(n, k) {
    factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))
}

choose(24, 12) == my_choose(24, 12)

```

Calculation of $\binom{24}{12}$:

-   With Base R function `choose(24, 12)` = `r choose(24, 12)`.
-   With my own function `my_choose(24, 12)` = `r my_choose(24, 12)`.

### Compute density of the binomial distribution {#sec-example-4-3}

To generalize I write my own function for the density of the binomial
distribution. I will use the same arguments names as in
@def-binom-dist-param.

```{r}
#| label: my-dbinom-func
#| attr-source: '#lst-my-dbinom-func lst-cap="**Function for the density of the binomial distribution**"'

my_dbinom <- function(k, n, p) {
    choose(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)
}

my_dbinom(12, 24, 0.5)
```

Voilá: It gives the same result as the manual calculation in
@lst-calc-example.

I wonder if there is not a Base R function which does the same as
`my_dbinom()`. I tried `stats::dbinom()` and it worked!

```{r}
#| label: dbinom-func
#| attr-source: '#lst-dbinom-func lst-cap="**Base R dbinom() function calculates the density of the binomial distribution**"'

dbinom(12, 24, 0.5)
```

Again the same result as in @lst-calc-example and @lst-my-dbinom-func!

### Replication of the Binomial Distribution of 10 Coin Flips {#sec-10-coin-flips}

Here I am going to try to replicate @fig-10-coin-flips.

```{r}
#| label: fig-repl-10-coin-flips
#| fig-cap: "Replication of Figure 4.1: Binomial Distribution of 10 Coin Flips with {ggplot2}"
#| attr-source: '#lst-repl-10-coin-flips lst-cap="**Replicate Figure 4.1: Binomial Distribution of 10 Coin Flips**"'

k_values <- seq.int(from = 0, to = 10 , by = 1)

data.frame(x = k_values, 
           y = dbinom(k_values, 10, 0.5)) |> 
    ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    ggplot2::geom_col()
```
Writing @lst-repl-10-coin-flips I had troubles applying the correct geom. At first I used `geom_bar()` but this did not work until I learned that I have to add the option "stat = identity" or to use `geom_col()`. The difference is:

- `geom_bar()` makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group. It uses `stat_count()` by default, e.g. it counts the number of cases at each x position. If there aren't cases but only the values then one has to add "stat = identity" to declare that ggplot2 should take the data "as-is".  
- `geom_col()` instead takes the heights of the bars to represent values in the data. It uses `stat_identity()` and leaves the data "as-is" by default.

::: {.callout-tip}

During my research for writing @lst-repl-10-coin-flips I learned of the {**tidydice**} package. It simulates dice rolls and coin flips and can be used for teaching basic  experiments in introductory statistics courses.

With {**tidydice**} we replicate Figure 4.1 with just 2 lines using the `binom_coin()` inside the `plot_binom()` function. In addition to the graphical distribution it print also the exact values on top of the bars. 


```{r}
#| label: fig-repl-10-coin-flips-2

tidydice::plot_binom(
  tidydice::binom_coin(10, sides = 2, success = 2),
  title = "Binomial distribution of 10 coin flips"
)
```
{**tidydice**} has many other functions related to coin and dice experiments.
